## Common Terms & Abbreviations

Understanding these key terms will help you navigate the pet travel process:

### Export vs. Import
- **EXPORT** = Pet leaves the US → Goes to another country
- **IMPORT** = Pet enters the US (includes US pets returning home)
- **Round-trip travel** = Both processes apply

### [IHC (International Health Certificate)](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel)
Also called an export health certificate. This is the official document required by most countries to allow your pet to enter. It includes exam findings, vaccination records, and treatments.

### [CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination)](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/index.html)
Official CDC document certifying your dog has a valid US rabies vaccination. Required for easy re-entry from [high-risk rabies countries](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html). **For dogs only.** See Section 3B for details.

### [USDA Endorsement](https://vehcs.aphis.usda.gov/)
Official review and stamp by the US Department of Agriculture on health certificates and CURV forms. Most countries require this. Documents are submitted electronically through VEHCS.

### [VEHCS (Veterinary Export Health Certification System)](https://vehcs.aphis.usda.gov/)
USDA's online system where accredited veterinarians submit and track health certificates and CURV forms for endorsement.

### Green Banner Country
Countries that **accept digital USDA endorsements**. We can email you the endorsed certificate once approved. No physical shipping required.
- **Examples:** Most South American countries
- **Cost advantage:** No shipping fees

### Orange Banner Country
Countries that **require physical USDA endorsement with embossed seal**. We must overnight ship your health certificate once approved.
- **Examples:** All European countries, United Kingdom
- **Additional cost:** $75 overnight shipping fee

### [High-Risk Rabies Country](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html)
Country on CDC's rabies high-risk list. If your destination is NOT on the list, it's considered low-risk.

### Primary (Initial) Rabies Vaccination
The **first** rabies vaccination given to a dog, OR the first vaccination after any lapse in coverage (even one day when rabies vaccination expired before the next booster). Valid for **only 1 year**, even if the vaccine label says 3 years. Some countries require waiting periods after primary vaccination before travel.

---

## Section 1: Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Avoid these costly and time-consuming mistakes by planning ahead:**

### 1. Not Having a Valid Rabies Vaccine Certificate
**❌ THE #1 DOCUMENTATION ISSUE**

**You may think you have a valid rabies vaccine certificate, but...**

Many certificates are missing critical information required for USDA endorsement. Even if your vet gave you a rabies certificate, it might not include everything needed for international travel.

#### Why This Happens:
- Many veterinarians (especially if not USDA-accredited) are unaware of specific USDA export requirements
- Certificates from other hospitals may lack required details
- Obtaining missing information can take **days or weeks** – or may be **impossible**
- In many cases, a **repeat rabies vaccination** is necessary to ensure proper documentation

#### ✅ Required Information on Rabies Certificates:

For USDA endorsement, your rabies certificate must include **ALL** of the following:

**Pet Information:**
- Name, weight, color, breed, age/date of birth
- Microchip number (only if microchip was implanted before that vaccine)
- ⚠️ **Important:** All information must match exactly on each certificate and medical record

**Vaccine Details:**
- Manufacturer name and vaccine type (note: "Killed" as a type is not accepted)
- Vaccination date and expiration date
- Expiration date of the vaccine product itself (from vaccine vial) – required for CURV

**Veterinarian Information:**
- Printed name, signature, and date signed
- License state and number
- Clinic contact information and address

**Owner Information:**
- Owner name, address, and contact information

---

### 2. Not Getting CURV Before Leaving (Dogs Only)
**❌ THE MOST EXPENSIVE MISTAKE**

If you're traveling to a **high-risk rabies country** and planning to return to the US, you **MUST** get a CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination) **BEFORE** you leave.

#### Without CURV:
- ❌ Complex, expensive re-entry process
- ❌ Cost: **$2,000-$7,000+**
- ❌ Limited entry points (only 6 airports in entire US)
- ❌ Mandatory facility stay (1+ nights)
- ❌ Requires advance facility reservations

#### With CURV:
- ✅ Easy re-entry at any US port
- ✅ No facility required
- ✅ Cost: **$435**

**→ See Section 2, Step 3 and Section 3B for full details**

---

### 3. Starting Too Late

**Timeline matters!** Some destinations require **6+ months** of preparation.

#### Complex Destinations (6+ months needed):
- **Australia, New Zealand, Japan**
  - Requirements: Multiple blood tests, rabies titer testing, waiting periods, import permits
  - **→ Schedule consultation immediately – do not book travel first**

#### European Union & UK (minimum 21 days):
- 21-day wait required after primary rabies vaccination
- Plan accordingly if your pet needs a primary vaccine

#### General Timeline:
- Start **2-6+ months** before departure depending on destination
- Allow time for: research, consultations, vaccinations, waiting periods, testing, documentation

---

### 4. Missing Critical Waiting Periods

**For Dogs:**
- **28-day wait** after primary rabies vaccination before CURV can be submitted
- **21-day wait** after primary rabies vaccination for EU/UK travel
- **30-90 days** for rabies titer results (some countries)

---

### 5. Letting US Rabies Vaccination Expire Abroad (Dogs)

If your dog's US rabies vaccination **expires while you're abroad**, your dog becomes "foreign-vaccinated" and must follow the complex, expensive re-entry process (Section 3C: **$2,000-$7,000+**).

**Solution:** Get a **3-year rabies booster** before extended travel so your CURV stays valid longer.

---

### 6. Not Checking Airline Requirements

Airlines often have requirements that are **MORE STRICT** than destination countries. It's **your responsibility** to verify and inform us of any additional requirements.

#### Common airline requirements:
- Health certificate within 10 days of arrival (for cargo pets)
- Temperature restrictions (typically 45-85°F at both departure and arrival)
- Limited pet spaces – book well in advance
- Specific crate requirements
- Airlines won't fly pets appearing sedated in cargo (safety reasons)

---

### 7. Booking Travel Before Meeting All Requirements

**Don't book flights or IHC appointments until:**

- ☐ All destination country requirements are met
- ☐ Required waiting periods have passed
- ☐ You've consulted with our hospital
- ☐ You've confirmed airline pet policies
- ☐ Temperatures will be safe for pet travel (45-85°F)

---

### 8. Not Planning for Temperature Restrictions

If your pet is flying cargo, airlines typically only fly when temperatures are **45-85°F at BOTH departure and arrival locations**.

Plan travel dates and flight times accordingly to avoid cancellations.

---

## Section 2: Exporting from the US

Our hospital is USDA-accredited and can complete all necessary export documentation for both dogs and cats. We submit all IHCs and CURVs electronically to [VEHCS](https://vehcs.aphis.usda.gov/) for endorsement by the USDA.

**Timeline:** Start 2-6+ months before departure depending on destination

### Important Notes:

The export process is the same for both dogs and cats, with a few key differences:
- **CURV:** Dogs only (needed for easy US re-entry from high-risk countries); cats don't need CURV
- Vaccines for dogs and cats differ (see Step 3)
- Some country requirements may differ for dogs vs cats

**Look Up Your Destination Requirements:** Check [USDA APHIS Pet Travel Guide](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/us-to-another-country-export) (step 2) for your destination country requirements.

---

### Understanding Green vs Orange Banner Countries

#### Green Banner Country 🟢
**Digital USDA endorsement accepted.** We can email you the endorsed certificate once approved. No physical shipping needed.
- **Examples:** Most South American countries, some Asian countries
- **Cost savings:** No shipping fee

#### Orange Banner Country 🟠
**Digital endorsement NOT accepted.** We must overnight ship your embossed USDA-endorsed health certificate once approved.
- **Examples:** All European countries, United Kingdom
- **Additional cost:** $75 overnight shipping fee

---

### Special Country Requirements

Some countries have requirements that can take significantly longer. Check destination country requirements early and plan well in advance.

#### Complex Destinations (6+ months):
- **Australia, New Zealand, Japan:** Multiple blood tests including rabies titer testing, waiting periods, import permits

#### EU/UK (minimum 21 days):
- Minimum 21-day wait after primary rabies vaccination

#### Countries with Rabies Titer Requirements:
- **Examples:** Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, China, Hawaii

---

### Step 1: Research & Consult with Our Hospital

**Before booking a consult, we will need to do some research, which incurs a non-refundable fee, even if your pet is ultimately unable to travel in the timeline you need.**

#### Initial Travel Information Required:

Before we can begin, you must provide for each pet:
- Destination country/countries
- Estimated travel dates
- Number and type (dog vs cat) of pets traveling
- Whether your pet will return to the US or if this is a permanent move
- Rabies vaccine history and certificates (all rabies vaccines ever given, starting with *first primary vaccine*)
- Microchip information and documentation (such as when implanted)
- Prior veterinary record location(s) with complete vaccine history
- Prior international travel records and/or rabies titer testing
- How you are traveling (car, air, ship)
- Name of airline, once known and if applicable
- Whether your pet will be in cargo, cabin, or excess baggage (if by plane once known)

#### Research Fee:
- **$100** for new clients/patients who are new to our hospital
- **$50** for existing pets
- **$0** if you've previously done a health certificate with us for this same country and pet
- **Non-refundable:** Must be paid for research to begin - paid via phone, text, or email
- Must be paid before scheduling your consultation

#### What This Fee Covers:
- Review USDA APHIS export requirements
- Review CDC re-entry requirements (if applicable)
- Determine if destination is low- or high-risk for rabies
- Gather and assess your pet's complete medical and rabies history
- Identify lapses or incomplete vaccine documentation
- Begin building your pet's personalized timeline along with any additional requirements needed for your pet
- We research and reach back out ASAP with information (same day to a few days depending on available information, travel timeline, and available prior vet records)

**We cannot give accurate guidance until we have complete records.**

---

### Step 2: Required International Travel Consultation & Exam

**An in-person consult is required before IHC appointment (unless timeline doesn't allow - see urgent fee below)**

- **Scheduled:** 2-3 months before departure when possible
- **Cost:** $95 (for both dogs and cats)

#### During this consultation, we will:
- Perform complete physical exam
- If present, scan your pet's microchip to ensure it is present and functioning
- Confirm ISO microchip compliance if required
- Review prior rabies documentation and timing
- Identify any vaccine gaps or lapses; update vaccines if appropriate
- Schedule and/or perform required testing or treatment (if needed)
- Review airline policy (general vs specific airline requirements & restrictions)
- Outline all steps needed for your destination for USDA endorsement and further discuss timeline of international health certificate exam/appointment
- Discuss travel tips, managing travel anxiety, and anxiety medication options if appropriate
  - **Note:** Airlines won't fly pets appearing sedated in cargo for safety - we carefully evaluate each case
- Answer all questions you may have

#### If timeline doesn't allow for separate consultation:
- All destination country requirements must be met in advance before the IHC visit
- The IHC visit cannot occur if requirements are not met in the appropriate time period
- **Urgent Processing Fee: $100** - This fee covers the extra staff time needed to ensure accurate documentation under time constraints when all research, record review, planning, and document preparation must occur same-day

---

### Common Requirements Information

#### Microchip:
- **Cost:** Placement $89, registration $20
- ISO-compliant/universal scanner required if destination requires it

#### Rabies Vaccination:
**Costs:**
- **Dogs:** $45
- **Cats:** $55 for 1-year vaccine or $98 for 3-year vaccine (if appropriate)
  - We use Purevax, which is a non-adjuvanted vaccine that reduces risk of injection-site reactions and tumors in cats

#### What's a "Primary" Vaccination?
Valid **1 year only**, even if vaccine says 3 years. This includes:
- First vaccination ever
- First vaccine after microchip placement
- First vaccine after any lapse in vaccination (any period, even one day, when rabies vaccination expired before next booster was given)
- First US vaccination for foreign-vaccinated dog

**Some destinations (such as any European country) require a "primary rabies vaccine" and 21-day wait.**

#### Additional Vaccines (if required by destination):

These vaccines are also generally recommended even if not required and are based on individual pet's lifestyle/exposure:

**Dogs:**
- DHPP (distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, parainfluenza), Bordetella, Lepto, etc.
- Cost: $45 each, $60 if DHPP + Lepto combo

**Cats:**
- FVRCP (feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, panleukopenia), FeLV (feline leukemia)
- Cost: $55 each

#### Rabies Titer Blood Draw (if required):
- May be done at consult if appropriate at that time (will be discussed) or scheduled later if rabies vaccination needs to occur first
- Must allow proper waiting periods before blood draw
- **Required by:** Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, China, Hawaii (and others)
- **Cost:** $370 (includes overnight shipping) to K-State or Auburn University (both OIE approved labs)
- **Timeline:** Takes 3-8 weeks depending on lab workload

### Step 3: Certification of US Issued Rabies Vaccination (CURV)
**DOGS ONLY** (Cats don't need one)

| Document | What It Is | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **International Health Certificate (IHC)** | Vet exam + health statement | To ENTER foreign country |
| **Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination (CURV)** | DOG only: US rabies vaccination certificate | To RETURN your dog to US from high-risk country |

**NOTE:** Your DOG may need BOTH for a round trip.

#### Do I need a CURV?

Check if your destination is [high-risk](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html):
- **YES, get CURV if:** Going to high-risk country AND planning to return to US
- **NO, skip to Step 4 if:** Only going to low-risk countries

#### What is CURV?
- Official CDC document certifying your dog's US rabies vaccination
- **Must be obtained BEFORE leaving the US** (cannot get after departure)
- Allows easy re-entry from high-risk countries → See Section 3B
- **Without it = expensive complex process** → See Section 3C ($2,000-7,000+)

#### Our hospital will:
1. Examine dog, verify rabies vaccination and microchip
2. Complete CURV in VEHCS system once you have submitted the required travel information to us
3. Submit to USDA for endorsement (can take days for endorsement, rarely weeks)
4. Email you the endorsed digital document once available

#### Requirements for CURV to be submitted by Bluebonnet:
- Current US rabies vaccination
- Microchip placed before/same time as current rabies vaccination
- If primary vaccination: 28-day wait before CURV submitted to USDA for endorsement
- You fill out appropriate travel information (we have a form for you to submit), so that we have the required information to be able to submit this form for USDA endorsement

**Cost:** $435 (CURV Submission is $310, USDA endorsement is $125)

**Timeline:** Allow 2-4 weeks before departure; 28-day wait if primary vaccination

**Pro Tip:** For extended travel, get 3-year rabies booster if appropriate so CURV stays valid longer

---

### Step 4: International Health Certificate (IHC) Appointment
**Applies to both dogs and cats**

**Schedule:** Within 10 days of departure (most countries) or per destination country requirement (some may be more or less). We will verify your destination's specific timing.

**Almost all countries require an IHC.**

#### ⚠️ REQUIRED: Pre-Health Certificate Travel Confirmation Form
**Must be completed at least 7 days before your health certificate appointment**

This form finalizes all travel logistics to be able to write your health certificate in a timely and appropriate manner. It includes:
- Travel dates
- Flight numbers, airline and routing, including port of embarkation and other layover locations
- Cargo vs. in-cabin confirmation
- Traveler and pet information, including origin and destination addresses and contact information
- Third party information helping with travel, if needed
- Confirmation that you have verified airline requirements

**If this form is not completed 48 hours before your appointment, your appointment may be canceled.**

#### Our IHC Appointment Process:

**Costs (same for dogs and cats):**
- Health certificate base fee: $310
- Physical exam and microchip scan/verification: $95
- USDA endorsement (most common): $125 (single certificate to verify vaccines only)
- USDA endorsement with vaccines and testing verification: $175-230 (such as rabies titer)
- Urgent Health Certificate Fee (if applicable): $100
- Shipping overnight if physical IHC needed (APHIS orange banner countries): $75
- Internal/external parasite treatment (if required): $30-150 per pet (varies based on size and country requirements)

#### Deposit & Rescheduling Policy:
- **Deposit required when booking:** $150 which will be applied toward your IHC visit
- **Rescheduling with >48 hr notice:** Additional $75 deposit required
- **Rescheduling <48 hours' notice or no-show:** Deposit is non-refundable; new full fee applies for rescheduled appointment

#### At the IHC Visit:
1. Perform complete physical exam and microchip scan/verification
2. Verify all vaccinations and treatments are current
3. Administer internal and external parasite treatment (if required by destination)
4. Complete appropriate health certificate for your destination country
5. Give any additional treatments/test to pet if indicated
6. Answer any final questions not yet addressed
7. **If USDA endorsement required:** Submit to USDA via VEHCS for endorsement, then email you the endorsed document (green banner countries - digital) or discuss facilitation of shipping endorsed IHC (orange banner countries - physical with embossed seal shipped overnight)
8. **If USDA endorsement not required:** Issue health certificate at this visit

---

### Step 5: Before You Leave
**Applies to both dogs and cats**

#### Confirm you have:
- ☐ International Health Certificate physical copy
- ☐ Most current rabies vaccine certificate (printed +/- digital)
- ☐ **For DOGS going to high-risk countries:** CURV - Keep this safe for return trip!
- ☐ Multiple copies of all documents (digital and/or printed)
- ☐ Appropriate airline-approved crate
- ☐ Import permit (if required by destination country)
- ☐ Any medication your pet may need to travel with
- ☐ Review Section 3 for your return requirements

#### Important Airline Requirements:
- Confirm airline accepts pets and method (cabin/checked/cargo)
- Airlines may have requirements more strict than the destination country - **it is the owner's responsibility** to check airline requirements and inform us of any additional needs
- Most airlines require a health certificate within 10 days of arrival to destination if in cargo. This requirement MAY vary if in-cabin with you. Dog and cat requirements may also be different.
- **For cargo pets:** Airlines typically only fly when temperatures are 45-85°F at BOTH departure and arrival locations for pet safety
- Book well in advance - limited pet spaces available
- Provide health certificate at check-in

**Departure day:** Bring all original documents, arrive early

---

## Section 3: Importing Dogs to the US

**Important:** US pets returning home must meet the same requirements as first-time imports.

---

### Section 3A: Dogs from Low-Risk Countries Only

**Applies if:** Dog has NOT been in any [high-risk country](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html) in last 6 months

#### Requirements:
✅ 6+ months old  
✅ Microchip is ISO-compliant with 15 digits (universal scanner)  
✅ Appears healthy  
✅ [CDC Dog Import Form](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/dog-import-form-instructions.html) completed online (for dogs only)

#### CDC Dog Import Form:
- Complete at least 1 day before arrival (can be done further in advance)
- Takes 5 minutes, **no fee (free)**, for dogs only
- Receipt emailed immediately (show on phone or print)
- Valid 6 months for multiple entries from same country

**Entry:** Any US airport, seaport, or land border

#### Additional notes:
- **Rabies vaccination is not required by CDC** (but recommended and often required by airlines and most US states)
  - [Check state requirements here](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/state-to-state)
- **USDA screwworm certification required if from affected country**
  - [Screwworm countries](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/another-country-to-us-import/dogs) (typically Central and South America)
  - Requirement: Approved veterinarian in departure country must examine dog and declare free of screwworm within 5 days of arrival to US
  - Certificate signed by government approved veterinary official of country of origin

---

### Section 3B: US-Vaccinated Dogs from High-Risk Countries (Easy Return)

**Applies if:** You got CURV before departure (see Section 2, Step 3)

#### Why This Is Easy:
✅ Enter at any port  
✅ No facility, no titer test, no quarantine  
✅ Minimal cost

#### Requirements:
All requirements from Section 3A apply, PLUS:

**Document 2:** CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination) obtained before you left the US and the current US rabies vaccine has not yet expired (foreign vaccinations don't count).

#### Arrival Process:
Present documents at customs → Clear normally → Go home

#### What If?

**Old export certificate instead of CURV?**
- Valid if issued on/before July 31, 2025 AND includes dog's age, microchip, and US rabies vaccination info
- May cause confusion with airlines - having CURV is clearer

**US rabies vaccination expires while abroad?**
- Dog becomes "foreign-vaccinated" → Must follow Section 3C ($2,000-7,000+)
- **Avoid this by getting 3-year booster before extended travel**

**Lost CURV?**
- Contact our hospital for replacement copy if CURV done by Bluebonnet

---

### Section 3C: Foreign-Vaccinated Dogs from High-Risk Countries (Complex Process)

**Applies if:** Dog lacks CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination) or US rabies vaccination expired abroad

**This is expensive/complex. Avoid by getting a CURV before departure (Section 2, Step 3).**

#### Process Summary:
- **MUST Start 60-90 days before US entry**
- Requires foreign vet certification with government endorsement
- Requires CDC-approved rabies titer test (to avoid quarantine)
- Must have advance reservation at CDC-registered facility
- Dog examined and revaccinated at facility upon arrival
- Usually 1-night stay; longer if weekend arrival
- **Costs Without Quarantine:** $2,000-3,000+
- **Costs With 28-day Quarantine:** $6,000-7,000+

#### Entry Points (ONLY These 6):
- **New York JFK** - The ARK Pet Oasis
- **Philadelphia PHL** - Gateway Animal Care Center
- **Washington IAD** - Pender Pet Retreat
- **Atlanta ATL** - Dandie Scottie Kennel
- **Miami MIA** - Pet Limo
- **Los Angeles LAX** - Kennel Club LAX or Rue's Kennels

**No land borders. No other airports. No domestic connections until released.**

For complete details on this process: [CDC Foreign-Vaccinated Dogs Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/foreign-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html)

#### Common Mistakes:
- No facility reservation = denied entry, dog returned
- Starting too late
- Booking flight before facility confirmation
- Not allowing proper waiting periods

**Again: This is why getting CURV before departure (Section 2, Step 3) is so important!**

---

### Section 3D: Importing Cats (Very Simple)

#### CDC Requirements:
✅ Cat appears healthy

**That's it!** No forms, no vaccinations required by CDC for cats. Entry at any point is acceptable.

#### However:
- Airlines usually require health certificate
- Rabies vaccination strongly recommended - most US states require it for cats
- Check your [destination state requirements](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/take-pet-to-another-state)
- **Hawaii/Guam:** Special quarantine requirements even from US mainland

---

## Section 4: Common Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Can I get CURV after my dog left the US?
**A:** No. Must be obtained before departure (as of July 31, 2025). Schedule your appointments with us early to ensure this is completed.

### Q: My dog's US rabies vaccination expires while abroad. What happens?
**A:** Dog becomes foreign-vaccinated → Section 3C process ($2,000-7,000+). Get 3-year booster before extended travel.

### Q: Do I need both IHC AND CURV?
**A:** Possibly. IHC = enter foreign country. CURV = return to US from high-risk country. You need IHC if destination requires it. You need CURV if going to high-risk country and returning to US.

### Q: Can puppies under 6 months enter the US?
**A:** No exceptions for any dogs from high-risk countries or returning from high-risk countries.

### Q: Can I drive across from Canada/Mexico?
**A:** Yes if coming from low-risk country. No if foreign-vaccinated from high-risk country (must fly to facility airport).

### Q: Do cats need CURV?
**A:** No. CURV is for dogs only. Cats have minimal CDC import requirements.

### Q: What about European Union or England travel?
**A:** EU and England require minimum 21-day wait after primary rabies vaccination. Plan accordingly and schedule early.

### Q: What about Australia, New Zealand, or Japan?
**A:** These require 6+ months preparation. Schedule research consultation with us immediately. Do not book travel before consulting with us.

### Q: What temperatures are safe for pets flying cargo?
**A:** Airlines typically only fly cargo pets when temperatures are 45-85°F at both departure and arrival cities. Plan travel dates and plane departure/arrival locations accordingly.

### Q: Do I need to check airline requirements?
**A:** Yes. Airlines may have requirements stricter than the destination country. It is your responsibility to check and inform us of any additional airline requirements.

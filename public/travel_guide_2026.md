## **Common Terms & Abbreviations**

Understanding these key terms will help you navigate the pet travel process:

### **Export vs. Import**

* **EXPORT** \= Pet leaves the US → Goes to another country

* **IMPORT** \= Pet enters the US (includes US pets returning home)

* **Round-trip travel** \= Both processes apply

### [**IHC (International Health Certificate)**](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel)

Also called an export health certificate. This is the official document required by most countries to allow your pet to enter. It includes exam findings, vaccination records, and treatments.

**To look up your destination country requirements:** Visit the [USDA APHIS Pet Travel website](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/us-to-another-country-export) and search for your destination country in step 2\. This is also where you’ll determine if your destination is a Green Banner or Orange Banner country.

### [**CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination)**](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/index.html)

Official CDC document certifying your dog has a valid US rabies vaccination. Required for easy re-entry from [high-risk rabies countries](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html). **For dogs only.** [See Section 3B](#section-3b) for details.

### [**USDA Endorsement**](https://vehcs.aphis.usda.gov/)

Official review and stamp by the US Department of Agriculture on health certificates and CURV forms. Most countries require this. Documents are submitted electronically through VEHCS.

### **VEHCS (Veterinary Export Health Certification System)**

USDA’s online system where accredited veterinarians submit and track health certificates and CURV forms for endorsement.

### **Green Banner Country**

Countries that **accept digital USDA endorsements**. We can email you the endorsed certificate once approved. No physical shipping required.

**How to identify:** When you search for your destination country on the [USDA APHIS website](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/us-to-another-country-export), a **green banner** will be displayed at the top of the country page if digital endorsement is accepted. 
- **Examples:** Most South American countries 
- **Cost advantage:** No shipping fees

### **Orange Banner Country**

Countries that **require physical USDA endorsement with embossed seal**. We must overnight ship your health certificate once approved.

**How to identify:** When you search for your destination country on the [USDA APHIS website](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/us-to-another-country-export), an **orange banner** will be displayed at the top of the country page if physical endorsement is required. 
- **Examples:** All EU countries, United Kingdom 
- **Additional cost:** $75 overnight shipping fee

### **High-Risk Rabies Country**

Country on CDC’s rabies [high-risk list](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html). If your destination is NOT on the list, it’s considered low-risk.

### **Primary (Initial) Rabies Vaccination**

The **first** rabies vaccination given to a dog, OR the first vaccination after any lapse in coverage (even one day when rabies vaccination expired before the next booster). Valid for **only 1 year**, even if the vaccine label says 3 years. Some countries require waiting periods after primary vaccination before travel.

---

<a id="section-1"></a>
## **Section 1: Common Mistakes to Avoid**

**Avoid these costly and time-consuming mistakes by planning ahead:**

### **1\. Not Having a Valid Rabies Vaccine Certificate**

**❌ THE \#1 DOCUMENTATION ISSUE**

**You may think you have a valid rabies vaccine certificate, but…**

Many certificates are missing critical information required for USDA endorsement. Even if your vet gave you a rabies certificate, it might not include everything needed for international travel.

#### *Why This Happens:*

* Many veterinarians (especially if not USDA-accredited) are unaware of specific USDA export requirements

* Certificates from other hospitals may lack required details

* Obtaining missing information can take **days or weeks** – or may be **impossible**

* In many cases, a **repeat rabies vaccination may be needed** to ensure proper documentation

**→ See [Section 4: Required Information on Rabies Certificates](#section-4) for complete details on what must be included.**

---

### **2\. Not Getting CURV Before Leaving OR Letting US Rabies Vaccination Expire (Dogs from High-Risk Countries Only)**

**❌ THE MOST EXPENSIVE MISTAKE**

If you’re traveling to a [**high-risk rabies country**](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html) and planning to return to the US, you **MUST**:

1. Get a CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination) **BEFORE** you leave

2. Ensure your dog’s US rabies vaccination does **NOT expire** while abroad

**If either of these fails, your dog becomes “foreign-vaccinated”** and must follow the complex re-entry process.

#### *Without CURV or with Expired US Rabies Vaccine:*

* ❌ Complex, expensive re-entry process

* ❌ Cost: **$2,000-$7,000+**

* ❌ Limited entry points (only 6 airports in entire US)

* ❌ Mandatory facility stay (1+ nights)

* ❌ Requires advance facility reservations

#### *With Valid CURV and Current US Rabies Vaccine:*

* ✅ Easy re-entry at any US port

* ✅ No facility required

* ✅ Cost: **$435** (for initial CURV)

**Solution for Extended Travel:** Get a **3-year rabies booster if your pet qualifies** before departure so your CURV stays valid longer.

**→ See [Section 2, Step 3](#section-2-step-3) and [Section 3B](#section-3b) for full details**

---

### **3\. Starting Too Late OR Missing Critical Waiting Periods**

**Timeline matters\!** Some destinations require **6+ months** of preparation, and missing critical waiting periods can delay your travel.

#### *Complex Destinations (6+ months needed):*

* **Australia, New Zealand, Japan**

  * Requirements: Rabies titer testing, waiting periods, import permits, etc.

  * **→ Schedule consultation immediately – do not book travel first**

#### *European Union & UK (minimum 21 days):*

* 21-day wait required after primary rabies vaccination

* Plan accordingly if your pet needs a primary vaccine

#### *General Timeline:*

* Start **2-6+ months** before departure depending on destination

* Allow time for: research, consultations, vaccinations, waiting periods, testing, documentation

---

### **4\. Not Checking Airline Requirements**

Airlines may have requirements that are more strict than destination countries (typically a 10-day travel window requirement for a health certificate or parasite treatment needed). It’s **your responsibility** to verify and inform us of any additional requirements.

**→ See [Section 5: Airline Requirements](#section-5) for complete details**

### **5\. Booking Travel Before Meeting All Requirements**

**Don’t book flights or IHC appointments until:**

* ☐ All destination country requirements are met

* ☐ Required waiting periods have passed

* ☐ You’ve consulted with our hospital

* ☐ You’ve confirmed airline pet policies

* ☐ Temperatures will be safe for pet travel (45-85°F)

---

<a id="section-2"></a>
## **Section 2: Exporting from the US**

Our hospital is USDA-accredited and can complete all necessary export documentation for both dogs and cats. We submit all IHCs and CURVs electronically to VEHCS for endorsement by the USDA.

**Timeline:** Start 2-6+ months before departure depending on destination

---

**Important Notes:**

**Look Up Your Destination Requirements:** Check [USDA APHIS Pet Travel Guide](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/us-to-another-country-export) (step 2\) for your destination country requirements.

The export process is the same for both dogs and cats, with a few key differences: 
- **CURV:** Dogs only (needed for easy US re-entry from high-risk countries); cats don’t need CURV 
- Vaccines for dogs and cats differ (see Step 3\) 
- Some country requirements may differ for dogs vs cats

---

### **Understanding Green vs Orange Banner Countries**

#### *Green Banner Country 🟢*

**Digital USDA endorsement accepted.** We can email you the endorsed certificate once approved. No physical shipping needed. 
- **Examples:** Most South American countries, some Asian countries 
- **Cost savings:** No shipping fee

#### *Orange Banner Country 🟠*

**Digital endorsement NOT accepted.** We must overnight ship your embossed USDA-endorsed health certificate once approved. 
- **Examples:** All European countries, United Kingdom 
- **Additional cost:** $75 overnight shipping fee

---

### **Step 1: Research & Consult with Our Hospital**

**Getting Started:** We’ll send you a form to complete with your pet’s travel plans and health history. Once submitted with the research fee, we can begin researching requirements and building your travel timeline.

**IMPORTANT:** We cannot proceed or give accurate guidance without complete information, including proper rabies vaccine certificates from ALL prior veterinary hospitals. Research incurs a **non-refundable fee**, even if your pet is ultimately unable to travel in your timeline.

#### *Initial Travel Information Required:*

Before we can begin, you must provide for each pet: 
- Destination country/countries 
- Estimated travel dates 
- Number and type (dog vs cat) of pets traveling 
- Whether your pet will return to the US or if this is a permanent move 
- **Rabies vaccine history and certificates** (all rabies vaccines ever given, starting with *first primary vaccine*) 
- **proper certificates from ALL prior veterinary hospitals are essential** 
- Microchip information and documentation (such as when implanted) 
- Prior veterinary record location(s) with complete vaccine history 
- Prior international travel records and/or rabies titer testing 
- How you are traveling (car, air, ship) 
- Name of airline, once known and if applicable 
- Whether your pet will be in cargo, cabin, or excess baggage (if by plane once known)

#### *Research Fee:*

* **$100** for new clients/patients who are new to our hospital

* **$50** for existing pets

* **$0** if you’ve previously done a health certificate with us for this same country and pet

* **Non-refundable:** Must be paid for research to begin 
- paid via phone, text, or email

* Must be paid before scheduling your consultation

#### *What This Fee Covers:*

* Review USDA APHIS export requirements

* Review CDC re-entry requirements (if applicable)

* Determine if destination is low- or high-risk for rabies

* Gather and assess your pet’s complete medical and rabies history

* Identify lapses or incomplete vaccine documentation

* Begin building your pet’s personalized timeline along with any additional requirements needed for your pet

* We research and reach back out ASAP with information (same day to a few days depending on available information, travel timeline, and available prior vet records)

**We cannot give accurate guidance until we have complete records.**

---

### **Step 2: Required International Travel Consultation & Exam**

**An in-person consult is required before IHC appointment (unless timeline doesn’t allow \- see urgent fee below)**

* **Scheduled:** 2-3 months before departure when possible

* **Cost:** $95 (for both dogs and cats)

#### *During this consultation, we will:*

* Perform complete physical exam

* If present, scan your pet’s microchip to ensure it is present and functioning

* Confirm ISO microchip compliance if required

* Review prior rabies documentation and timing

* Identify any vaccine gaps or lapses; update vaccines if appropriate

* Schedule and/or perform required testing or treatment (if needed)

* Review airline policy (general vs specific airline requirements & restrictions)

* Outline all steps needed for your destination for USDA endorsement and further discuss timeline of international health certificate exam/appointment

* Discuss travel tips, managing travel anxiety, and anxiety medication options if appropriate

* Answer all questions you may have

#### *If timeline doesn’t allow for separate consultation:*

* All destination country requirements must be met in advance before the IHC visit

* The IHC visit cannot occur if requirements are not met in the appropriate time period

* **Urgent Processing Fee: $100** 
- This fee covers the extra staff time needed to ensure accurate documentation under time constraints when all research, record review, planning, and document preparation must occur same-day

---

### **Common Requirements & Country-Specific Timelines**

**Important:** Some countries have requirements that can take significantly longer. Check destination country requirements early and plan well in advance. The requirements below are common to most destinations, with specific timeline requirements noted.

#### *Microchip (if required by country and not already present)*

* **Cost:** Placement $89, registration $20

* ISO-compliant/universal scanner required if destination requires it

#### *Rabies Vaccination (if required by country and not already current)*

**What’s a “Primary” Rabies Vaccination?**  
Valid **1 year only**, even if vaccine says 3 years. A primary vaccination is: 
- First vaccination ever 
- First vaccine after microchip placement 
- First vaccine after any lapse in vaccination (any period, even one day, when rabies vaccination expired before next booster was given) 
- First US vaccination for foreign-vaccinated dog

**Special Note on Timing:** 
- **Most European countries/UK:** Minimum 21-day wait after primary rabies vaccination required

**Costs:** 
- **Dogs:** $45 
- **Cats:** $55 for 1-year vaccine or $98 for 3-year vaccine (if appropriate) 
- We use Purevax, which is a non-adjuvanted vaccine that reduces risk of injection-site reactions and tumors in cats

#### *Additional Vaccines (if required by country and not already current)*

These vaccines are also generally recommended based on individual pet’s lifestyle/exposure:

**Dogs:** 
- DHPP (distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, parainfluenza), Bordetella, Lepto, etc. 
- **Cost:** $45 each, $60 if DHPP \+ Lepto combo

**Cats:** 
- FVRCP (feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, panleukopenia), FeLV (feline leukemia) 
- **Cost:** $55 each

#### *Rabies Titer Blood Draw (if required by country and not already performed)*

**When it’s required:** 
- **Required by:** Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, China, Hawaii (and others) 
- **NOT required by:** Most South American and European countries

**Process & Timeline:** 
- May be done at consult if appropriate timing allows, or scheduled later if rabies vaccination needs to occur first 
- Must allow proper waiting periods before blood draw 
- **Cost:** $370 (includes overnight shipping) to K-State or Auburn University (both OIE approved labs) 
- **Timeline:** Takes 3-6 weeks after test is performed

**Country-Specific Rabies Titer Timelines:** 
- **Australia, New Zealand, Japan:** 6-month timeline required (rabies titer testing, waiting periods, import permits, etc.) 
- **Other countries requiring rabies titer:** Shorter timeline possible, but will vary based on requirements of that country. Most will just need a valid rabies titer test result at the time of export, but we need to verify specific requirements for your destination

<a id="section-2-step-3"></a>
### **Step 3: Certification of US Issued Rabies Vaccination (CURV)**

**DOGS ONLY** (Cats don’t need one)

| Document | What It Is | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **International Health Certificate (IHC)** | Vet exam \+ health statement | To ENTER foreign country |
| **Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination (CURV)** | DOG only: US rabies vaccination certificate | To RETURN your dog to US from high-risk country |

**NOTE:** Your DOG may need BOTH for a round trip.

#### *Do I need a CURV?*

Check if your destination is a [high-risk rabies country](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html): 
- **YES, get CURV if:** Going to high-risk country AND planning to return to US 
- **NO, skip to Step 4 if:** Only going to low-risk countries

#### *What is CURV?*

* Official CDC document certifying your dog’s US rabies vaccination

* **Must be obtained BEFORE leaving the US** (cannot get after departure)

* Allows easy re-entry from high-risk countries → [See Section 3B](#section-3b)

* **Without it \= expensive complex process** → [See Section 3C](#section-3c) ($2,000-7,000+)

#### *Our hospital will:*

1. Examine dog, verify rabies vaccination and microchip

2. Complete CURV in VEHCS system once you have submitted the required travel information to us

3. Submit to USDA for endorsement (can take days for endorsement, rarely weeks)

4. Email you the endorsed digital document once available

#### *Requirements for CURV to be submitted by Bluebonnet:*

* Current US rabies vaccination

* Microchip placed before/same time as current rabies vaccination

* If primary vaccination: 28-day wait before CURV submitted to USDA for endorsement

* You fill out appropriate travel information (we have a form for you to submit), so that we have the required information to be able to submit this form for USDA endorsement

**Cost:** $435 (CURV Submission is $310, USDA endorsement is $125)

**Timeline:** Allow 2-4 weeks before departure; 28-day wait if primary vaccination

**Pro Tip:** For extended travel, get 3-year rabies booster if appropriate so CURV stays valid longer

---

### **Step 4: International Health Certificate (IHC) Appointment**

**Applies to both dogs and cats**

**Schedule:** Within 10 days of departure (most countries) or per destination country requirement (some may be more or less). We will verify your destination’s specific timing.

**Almost all countries require an IHC.**

#### *⚠️ REQUIRED: Pre-Health Certificate Travel Confirmation Form*

**When you book your IHC appointment, we’ll send you a confirmation text with a link to this form.**

This form must be completed **at least 7 days before your health certificate appointment** and finalizes all travel logistics to write your health certificate in a timely manner. It includes: 
- Travel dates 
- Flight numbers, airline and routing, including port of embarkation and other layover locations 
- Cargo vs. in-cabin confirmation 
- Traveler and pet information, including origin and destination addresses and contact information 
- Third party information helping with travel, if needed 
- Confirmation that you have verified airline requirements

**⚠️ If this form is not completed 48 hours before your appointment, your appointment may be canceled.**

#### *Our IHC Appointment Process & Costs:*

**At the Visit:** 1\. Complete physical exam and microchip scan/verification ($95) 2\. Verify all vaccinations and treatments are current 3\. Administer internal/external parasite treatment if required ($30-150, varies by size and country) 4\. Complete health certificate for your destination country ($310 base fee) 5\. Give any additional treatments/tests if indicated 6\. Answer final questions 7\. Submit to USDA via VEHCS for endorsement (if required): $125 standard or $175-230 with testing verification

**After the Visit 
- USDA Endorsement:** Once we submit your IHC to USDA for endorsement, the timeline for endorsement is **beyond our control**. We do our best to ensure your pet can travel on time, but please be aware: 
- Most endorsements are completed within a few days 
- **In some cases**, endorsement may occur just prior to your travel date, with your pet barely making the departure window 
- **In rare cases** (such as high USDA workload during holiday seasons), endorsement may not occur in time, requiring another visit and additional fees

Once endorsed, we will: 
- **Green banner countries:** Email you the endorsed digital document 
- **Orange banner countries:** Overnight ship the embossed physical certificate ($75). At your IHC visit, we’ll discuss where the certificate should be shipped. We recommend shipping to our hospital for pick-up once it arrives, but in some situations, a specific destination address may be needed. Proper shipping location will be discussed if this applies to your IHC.

**Deposit & Rescheduling:** 
- Deposit required when booking: $150 (applied toward IHC visit) 
- Rescheduling \>48 hrs notice: Additional $75 deposit required 
- Rescheduling \<48 hrs or no-show: Deposit non-refundable; new full fee for rescheduled appointment 
- Urgent Processing Fee (if no prior consult): $100

---

<a id="section-3b"></a>
### **Section 3B: US-Vaccinated Dogs from High-Risk Countries (Easy Return)**

**Applies if:** You got CURV before departure ([see Section 2, Step 3](#section-2-step-3))

---

*Why This Is Easy:*

✅ Enter at any port  
✅ No facility, no titer test, no quarantine  
✅ Minimal cost

---

*Requirements:*

All requirements from [Section 3A](#section-3a) apply, PLUS:

**Document 2:** CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination) obtained before you left the US and the current US rabies vaccine has not yet expired (foreign vaccinations don’t count).

---

*Arrival Process:*

Present documents at customs → Clear normally → Go home

---

*What If?*

**Old export certificate instead of CURV?** 
- Valid if issued on/before July 31, 2025 AND includes dog’s age, microchip, and US rabies vaccination info 
- May cause confusion with airlines 
- having CURV is clearer

**US rabies vaccination expires while abroad?** 
- Dog becomes "foreign-vaccinated" → Must follow [Section 3C](#section-3c) ($2,000-7,000+) 
- **Avoid this by getting 3-year booster before extended travel**

**Lost CURV?** 
- Contact our hospital for replacement copy if CURV done by Bluebonnet

---

<a id="section-3c"></a>
### **Section 3C: Foreign-Vaccinated Dogs from High-Risk Countries (Complex Process)**

**Applies if:** Dog lacks CURV (Certification of US-Issued Rabies Vaccination) or US rabies vaccination expired abroad

**This is expensive/complex. Avoid by getting a CURV before departure ([Section 2, Step 3](#section-2-step-3)).**

---

*Process Summary:*

* **MUST Start 60-90 days before US entry**

* Requires foreign vet certification with government endorsement

* Requires CDC-approved rabies titer test (to avoid quarantine)

* Must have advance reservation at CDC-registered facility

* Dog examined and revaccinated at facility upon arrival

* Usually 1-night stay; longer if weekend arrival

* **Costs Without Quarantine:** $2,000-3,000+

* **Costs With 28-day Quarantine:** $6,000-7,000+

---

*Entry Points (ONLY These 6):*

* **New York JFK** - The ARK Pet Oasis

**No land borders. No other airports. No domestic connections until released.**

For complete details on this process: [CDC Foreign-Vaccinated Dogs Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/foreign-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html)

---

*Common Mistakes:*

* No facility reservation \= denied entry, dog returned

* Starting too late

* Booking flight before facility confirmation

* Not allowing proper waiting periods

**Again: This is why getting CURV before departure ([Section 2, Step 3](#section-2-step-3)) is so important\!**

---

<a id="section-3d"></a>
### **Section 3D: Importing Cats (Very Simple)**


*CDC Requirements:*

✅ Cat appears healthy

**That’s it\!** No forms, no vaccinations required by CDC for cats. Entry at any point is acceptable.

---

*However:*

* Airlines usually require health certificate

* Rabies vaccination strongly recommended 
- most US states require it for cats

* Check your [destination state requirements](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/take-pet-to-another-state)

* **Hawaii/Guam:** Special quarantine requirements even from US mainland

---

<a id="section-4"></a>

## **Section 6: Common Questions (FAQ)**

### **Q: Can I get CURV after my dog left the US?**

**A:** No. Must be obtained before departure (as of July 31, 2025). Schedule your appointments with us early to ensure this is completed.

### **Q: My dog’s US rabies vaccination expires while abroad. What happens?**

**A:** Dog becomes foreign-vaccinated → [Section 3C](#section-3c) process ($2,000-7,000+). Get 3-year booster before extended travel.

### **Q: Do I need both IHC AND CURV?**

**A:** Possibly. IHC \= enter foreign country. CURV \= return to US from high-risk country. You need IHC if destination requires it. You need CURV if going to high-risk country and returning to US.

### **Q: Can puppies under 6 months enter the US?**

**A:** No exceptions for any dogs from high-risk countries or returning from high-risk countries.

### **Q: Can I drive across from Canada/Mexico?**

**A:** Yes if coming from low-risk country. No if foreign-vaccinated from high-risk country (must fly to facility airport).

### **Q: Do cats need CURV?**

**A:** No. CURV is for dogs only. Cats have minimal CDC import requirements.

### **Q: What about European Union or England travel?**

**A:** EU and England require minimum 21-day wait after primary rabies vaccination. Plan accordingly and schedule early.

### **Q: What about Australia, New Zealand, or Japan?**

**A:** These require 6+ months preparation. Schedule research consultation with us immediately. Do not book travel before consulting with us.

### **Q: What temperatures are safe for pets flying cargo?**

**A:** Airlines typically only fly cargo pets when temperatures are 45-85°F at both departure and arrival cities. Plan travel dates and plane departure/arrival locations accordingly.

### **Q: Do I need to check airline requirements?**

**A:** Yes. Airlines may have requirements stricter than the destination country. It is your responsibility to check and inform us of any additional airline requirements.

### **Q: My departure date is coming up soon and my health certificate hasn’t been endorsed yet. Should I be worried?**

**A:** We understand your concern\! Once we submit your IHC to USDA for endorsement, the timing is beyond our control. Most endorsements are completed within a few days, but sometimes endorsement occurs just prior to your travel date. We do our best to ensure your pet can travel on time. In rare cases (such as high USDA workload during holiday seasons), endorsement may be delayed, potentially requiring another visit and additional fees. This is why we recommend starting the process 2-6+ months before departure and avoiding peak holiday travel times when possible.
